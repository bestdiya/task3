# Task 3 - Data Analyst Internship: SQL for Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries and results for Task 3 of the Data Analyst Internship assignment. The task involved using SQL to extract and analyze data from a structured database.

## Dataset
The queries are executed on the **Chinook** sample database, which simulates an ecommerce store with tables such as customers, invoices, albums, artists, and tracks.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench (version X.X)
- MySQL Server (version X.X)

## What I Did
- Imported the Chinook database schema and data into MySQL Workbench.
- Wrote SQL queries demonstrating:
  - Data selection with filters (`SELECT`, `WHERE`)
  - Aggregations and grouping (`GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
  - Joining multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`)
  - Using subqueries
  - Creating and querying SQL views
  - Index creation for optimization
  - Handling NULL values
- Ran queries and captured outputs as screenshots for submission.

## Files Included
- `task3.sql` — SQL script containing all queries written for the task.
- `screenshots/` — Folder containing screenshots of query outputs.
- `README.md` — This documentation file.

## How to Run
1. Import the Chinook database (`Chinook.sql`) into your MySQL server.
2. Run the queries in `task3.sql` using MySQL Workbench or any SQL client connected to the Chinook database.
3. View the results to verify output.
